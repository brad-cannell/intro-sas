Lab Assignment 
Module 10: Hypothesis Testing

In this week’s lab we will practice using SAS to calculate confidence intervals around point 
estimates of means and proportions. We will also use SAS to conduct hypothesis tests for 
differences in means and frequency distributions. 

This code is posted for your benefit; however, I highly recommend that you practice typing your
own SAS programs as well. With the SAS programming language, as with all new languages, immersion 
seems to be the best way to learn.

/*
Task 1. 
Some studies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have shown an increase in CO2 production in patients 
with the disease. In one such study the following CO2 values were obtained from 16 neocortical 
biopsy samples from AD patients.
*/


*Write a SAS program to calculate the mean value of CO2 along with its corresponding 95% confidence 
interval.;




/*
Task 2. 
Does sensory deprivation have an effect on a person’s alpha-wave frequency? Twenty volunteer 
subjects were randomly divided into two groups. Subjects in group A were subjected to a 10-day 
period of sensory deprivation, while subjects in group B served as controls. At the end of the 
experimental period, the alpha-wave frequency component of subjects’ electroencephalograms was 
measured. The results were as follows:
*/


*Write a SAS program to test for a difference in mean alpha wave frequency between groups.;




/*
Task 3. 
The following table shows the time (in minutes) for subjects to feel relief from headache pain:
*/


*Write a SAS program to test for a difference in mean time to relief between medications;




/*
Task 4. 
Please copy, paste, and run the following SAS code to perform a Chi-Square test:
