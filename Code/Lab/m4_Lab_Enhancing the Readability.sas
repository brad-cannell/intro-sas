Module 4: Enhancing the Readability of SAS Data Sets

This code is posted for your benefit; however, I highly recommend that you practice typing your
own SAS programs as well. With the SAS programming language, as with all new languages, immersion 
seems to be the best way to learn.

/*
Task 1. 
Create a new permanent SAS data set from the hospital survey data called hosp1. 
In the same step, use the Hospital Survey Codebook to create SAS labels for all variables in the data set.
*/



/*
Task 2. 
Using the CONTENTS procedure, produce a report about the contents of the hosp1 data set. 
Save it as Lab4_Task2.html. Give the report a descriptive title, a subtitle with 
your name, and a footnote with the current date and time.
*/



/*
Task 3. 
Using the FORMAT procedure, create formats for the following variables: 
ins, pro1, pro2, food, clean, check1, check2, and reco.
*/



/*
Task 4.  
Create a list report of the first 10 observations in your data. 
Make sure to apply the variable labels you created in Task 1, and the formats you 
created in Task 4. Save it as Lab4_Task4.html.Give the report a descriptive title, 
a subtitle with your name, and a footnote with the current date and time.
*/



/*
Task 5. 
Run the CONTENTS procedure on the hosp1 data set. 
Save the report as Lab4_Task5.html. Give the report a descriptive title, 
a subtitle with your name, and a footnote with the current date and time.
*/



/*
Task 6. 
In a DATA step create a new data set called hosp2.
Permanently assign formats for the following variables:
ins, pro1, pro2, food, clean, check1, check2, and reco.
*/



/*
Task 7. 
Run the CONTENTS procedure on the hosp1 data set. 
Save the report as Lab4_Task7.html. 
Give the report a descriptive title, a subtitle with your name, 
and a footnote with the current date and time.
*/



/*
Task 8. Create a list report of observations 5 -15 only. 
Save the report as Lab4_Task8.html. Give the report a descriptive 
title, a subtitle with your name, and a footnote with the current 
date and time.
