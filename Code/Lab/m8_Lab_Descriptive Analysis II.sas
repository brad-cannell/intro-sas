Lab Assignment 
Module 8: Descriptive Analysis II

In this week’s lab you will practice describing relationships between variables. Specifically, 
you will practice basic descriptive techniques appropriate for analysis of a continuous predictor 
variable and continuous outcome variable, a categorical predictor variable and a continuous 
outcome variable, or a categorical predictor variable and categorical outcome variable.

This code is posted for your benefit; however, I highly recommend that you practice typing your
own SAS programs as well. With the SAS programming language, as with all new languages, immersion 
seems to be the best way to learn.

/*
Task 1. 
Using the CORR procedure,explore the relationship between age and initial heart rate also, 
examine the correlation coefficient and the p-value.
*/


/*
Task 2. 
Explore the relationship between age and initial heart rate by creating a scatter plot. Make sure
to add an OLS regression line. View this scatter plot again separately for men and women.
*/



/*
Task 3. 
Calculate mean bmi within levels of gender using the MEANS procedure
*/



/*
Task 4. 
Produce side-by-side histograms of sysbp comparing gender.
*/



/*
Task 5. 
side-by-side boxplots of bmi comparing gender
*/



/*
Task 6. 
Create a two-way frequency table for cohort year and history of cardiovascular disease.
*/



/*
Task 7. 
Create multiple two-way frequency tables for cohort year and atrial fibrillation, cohort year and 
cardiogenic shock, cohort year and congestive heart complications, and cohort year and complete 
heart block.
